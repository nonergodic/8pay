    "# 8Pay valuation model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Token Setup\n",
    "8pay collects a fee of 1 \\% of all payments made through their system. Half of those fees will go to 8pay and half will be redistributed among all stakers of the 8pay token on e.g. a weekly basis. As such, the 8pay token currently functions as a security token and its value depends entirely on the future cashflow provided by fees via staking, since its additional function of working as a means of exchange is satisfied in a superior fashion by stable coins such as TUSD or USDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisits\n",
    "To calculate the value of the entire token supply, we have to figure out the transaction volume (number of transactions times average transaction value) which serves as the basis from which fees are taken, along with a discount rate. The discount rate can include a lot of other factors, such as real interest rate (i.e. nominal interest rates minus inflation rate) or risk - and perhaps it should even take the yield curve into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling\n",
    "The implemented model sums the discounted cashflows over the given time horizon and assumes that after that time horizon has been reached, cashflows remaining constant at the amount of the time horizon crossing. Compounding is done on a \"per period\" basis, with periods being either yearly, quarterly, monthly, or weekly. Rates are adjusted to always yield the specified discount rate on an annual basis. To model the transaction count, I chose a parameterized S-shaped curve with initial exponential growth that eventually saturates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicability\n",
    "The main issues with this model are of course the uncertainty involved in the entire venture itself, the projection of the number of 8pay transactions and their average value, along with the interest rates that come to bear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "This model is mainly intended as a toy model aimed at illustrating the approach that ought to be taken to calculate the fair value of the 8pay token at any point in time, given known data. To get to a better evaluation for investors, one could use this model to generate different scenarios (e.g. small, medium, and large scale adoption), assign probabilities to these scenarios and then do an expected value calculation based on those numbers."

    "Goal: we are looking for our total discounted cashflow $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the per period discount rate $d_p$ via:\n",
    "$$ d_p = \\sqrt[p]{d_a} $$\n",
    "(For example, a 10 % annual discount rate implies $d_a = 1.1$ and $d_p \\approx 1.0241$)\n",

    "Now, we split our $h$ years until the time horizon into $p$ periods each, for a total of $h p$ periods.\n",

    "$$ \\hat{c}_i = f v_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, to arrive at the discounted cashflow $c_i$, we discount $\\hat{c}_i$ $i$ times using our per period discount rate $d_p$:\n",
    "$$ c_i = \\frac{\\hat{c}_i}{{d_p}^i} $$\n",

    "### Putting some numbers on it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discount rate\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this dataset (http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/wacc.htm), the cost of capital - which is, in our model, the discount rate - for both online retail and software businesses, which seem like a relevant comparison, is roughly 10%. In light of the novelty and perceived risk of the blockchain sector, one might double this for estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-revenue VC valuations\n",
    "\n",
    "All the valuations our model calculates are predicated on the assumption that the project succeeds. But most start-ups do not, and so when valuing a pre-revenue start-up, a venture capitalist cannot do so on the premise of its success; rather, the valuation-given-success has to be discounted for the success rate among the projects the VC invests in. This means dividing the estimated valuation by a significant number, often between 20 and 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Staking percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, coins with staking or delegation mechanisms tend to have between 20 and 50 percent of their supply staked (e.g. EOS, Cosmos, LTO). We expect this percentage to be noticeably higher for 8pay due to the ease of staking and the directness of the incentive. To put a ballpark number on it, 75% might be a reasonable lower bound. Since the valuation we calculate above with our model is the valuation of the staked supply, and the value of a token is the value of the marginal staked token, we get to divide this number by 0.75 for an estimate of the valuation of the total supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might take into account growth of the supply as an additional complication; however, this is mostly of relevance in the first years when the value of transactions is still relatively low and would therefore not change the result drastically. The additional benefit from including this in the calculation doesn't seem worth the complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix currently has annual revenue of about \\\\$16B, which is 1.6B transactions at \\\\$10 each. Setting this as limit, to be reached in about 10 years with the half-way point at 5 years, and the discount rate to 20%, the model returns a value of discounted future cashflows of \\\\$181,535,000. With a 75% staking percentage, that would amount to \\\\$242,047,000 total supply valuation. Divided by 20 for the VC factor, and by 2 once more for selling only 50% of the supply, that would justify a raise of \\\\$6M. Note that this is in itself a highly optimistic scenario, implying a transaction volume of roughly $1B in year two!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is, naturally, predicated on 8pay's ability to stay relevant for an extended period of time; paying in ERC20 stable tokens on the Ethereum chain is unlikely to be the end state of crypto payments."
