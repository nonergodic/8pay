    "# 8Pay valuation model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Token Setup\n",
    "8pay collects a fee of 1 \\% of all payments made through their system. Half of those fees will go to 8pay and half will be redistributed among all stakers of the 8pay token on e.g. a weekly basis. As such, the 8pay token currently functions as a security token and its value depends entirely on the future cashflow provided by fees via staking, since its additional function of working as a means of exchange is satisfied in a superior fashion by stable coins such as TUSD or USDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisits\n",
    "To calculate the value of the entire token supply, we have to figure out the transaction volume (number of transactions times average transaction value) which serves as the basis from which fees are taken, along with a discount rate. The discount rate can include a lot of other factors, such as real interest rate (i.e. nominal interest rates minus inflation rate) or risk - and perhaps it should even take the yield curve into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling\n",
    "The implemented model sums the discounted cashflows over the given time horizon and assumes that after that time horizon has been reached, cashflows remaining constant at the amount of the time horizon crossing. Compounding is done on a \"per period\" basis, with periods being either yearly, quarterly, monthly, or weekly. Rates are adjusted to always yield the specified discount rate on an annual basis. To model the transaction count, I chose a parameterized S-shaped curve with initial exponential growth that eventually saturates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicability\n",
    "The main issues with this model are of course the uncertainty involved in the entire venture itself, the projection of the number of 8pay transactions and their average value, along with the interest rates that come to bear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "This model is mainly intended as a toy model aimed at illustrating the approach that ought to be taken to calculate the fair value of the 8pay token at any point in time, given known data. To get to a better evaluation for investors, one could use this model to generate different scenarios (e.g. small, medium, and large scale adoption), assign probabilities to these scenarios and then do an expected value calculation based on those numbers."

    "\n",
    "We calculate the per period discount rate $d_p$ via:\n",
    "$$ d_p = \\sqrt[p]{d_a} $$\n",
    "(For example, a 10 % annual discount rate implies $d_a = 1.1$ and $d_p \\approx 1.0241$)\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our logistic transaction rate function $\\tau(t)$ which yields the annualized rate of transactions at time $t$ via:\n",

    "Now, we split our $h$ years until the time horizon into $p$ periods each, for a total of $h p$ periods.\n",

    "$$ \\hat{c}_i = f v_i $$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$ c_i = \\frac{\\hat{c}_i}{{d_p}^i} $$\n",
